# 0812 Week 4

The self-learning for on tools should be done by now.

It is expected to start the dart package implementation.

this week should identify confirm all the references:
- 1. porting based on which version of S2 (javascript? java?)
- 2. complete setup python S2 geometry library as a reference, and compare the result with the ported dart version.
- 3. start to implement the dart version of S2 geometry library.

I am expecting to see a daily commit with testing for code review.
