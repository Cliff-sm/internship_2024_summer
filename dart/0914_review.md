# Week 8 review

I saw coverage report in code. 
but it better give a summary for project coverage and don't commit the coverage report to the git.
Just mention how to run the coverage report in the README.md file.




## Questions
What Projects should the intern focus on next week?
please summarize next week's markdown file yourself.

What is one thing the intern can do next week to improve?
it is time to update the README.md and prepare to update to pub.dev and start a flutter demo project
```
