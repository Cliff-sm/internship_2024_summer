# Onboarding Meeting



## Git

- open github account
- open a repository (for familiarization, any name for testing)
- learn how to create a repository, sync with your local machine, and push changes to the repository
- find a git tutorial, learn the basic commands
  - 1. git clone / pull / push , work on master(main) branch on your own
  - 2. create a (feature) branch, make changes, merge to master(main)


- collaborated project (2nd project)
  - 1. create anther repository, add team-mate as a collaborator
  - 2. write a text based calculator in any language, create a branch, make changes, merge to master(main), write test cases. the calculator could be simple, just + , -, /, * operations, and '(' ')' for precedence
  - 3. learn how to collaborate with team-mate, resolve conflicts, and merge changes
  - no code duplicate whole project from external source, write your own code (with AI assistance)
    

Question: which language to use? 
Go / typescript / python / dart



## Github co-pilot + VSCode
Apply for github co-pilot, install the extension in VSCode, and learn how to use it.
if you have another AI tools, please let me know.

### the target: 
- no point to write on your own, 
- use comments to guide the AI to generate the code (so you code will have documentation)
- just use the AI to generate the code, review it, fix it,  
- write unit test to verify it (AI could help to generate the test cases, but you need to review it, and fix it)

## Daily update
- use a git for daily update
- month as folder, date code as filename, use markdown format
- each working day has one file, write the planning of the day in the morning, and the summary of the day in the evening
- commit to github
- add cliff@smart-minds.io as a collaborator so that I could review it

## BI and dashboard reports
- propose the tools
- tools to generate testing data based on schema (incomplete, just main model)
- convert schema to model of target language
- flow/tools to generate the report
