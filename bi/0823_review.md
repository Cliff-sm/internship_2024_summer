# Week 5 review
the project start to see some progress.
the coming focus would be:
1. finalize the dashboard output (using Power BI first, current version could be the one, unless you still have some idea to improve it)

2. port to dashboard to Vue3 with Chart.js

see 
https://www.chartjs.org/
https://vue-chartjs.org/guide/#updating-charts

search some tutorial for more reference:

each dashboard item should be convert to a Vue3 component and use json data source to do a demo first.

A sample Vue3 component project could be provided later on coming week when the porting started.
