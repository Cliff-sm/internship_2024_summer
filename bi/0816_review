# Week 4 review

The project structure is much better now, but it still needs some improvement.

Filename not match with class name
e.g. saas_partner_order_generator.py
saas_task_data_generator.py,
saas_work_order_generator.py

all using 'MockDFGenerator'

The `MockOrderDataStructured` seems to be flexible for later adjustment in requirement. 

But right now I don't see a config file for the generator and the script for generate the test data set based on the config file.


## Questions
What Projects should the intern focus on next week?
please summarize next week's markdown file yourself.

What is one thing the intern can do next week to improve?
- use spell checker (daily update still have some spelling error)
- could start to outline the whole project, write a brief description of each module and the relationship between them.
