# Week 7 review

the comment is same as last week:
Need code review to ensure the the project unit is `component` each component should have be standalone and have its own data source.

As I still didn't get short demo on work flow and no code update (I don't have the git repository).

It is important to have a right way to do the implementation. 



## Questions
What Projects should the intern focus on next week?
please summarize next week's markdown file yourself.

What is one thing the intern can do next week to improve?
need more code review. at least twice per week. (e.g. Wednesday and friday)
