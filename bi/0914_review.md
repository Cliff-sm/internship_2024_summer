# Week 8 review

the code look better. I caught two issues (see images files)
(20240915_file_name_not_match.png / 20240915_unused_file.png)

foreach component, it seem it has a config file not used. e.g. (box_plot_data.ts in BoxPlot)
I didn't see you use the BoxPlotRepository to provide data to the BoxPlot component.

I have request for a work flow demo for three week. but still didn't get it.
